<title> the lion </title>
<p> The lion <i> Panthera leo</i> is a species in the family Felidae; it is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears, 
and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually <em> dimorphic</em>; adult male lions have a prominent mane, which is the most recognisable feature of the species.
With a typical head-to-body length of 184–208<abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr> (72–82<abbr title="inches">in</abbr>) they are larger than females at 160–184<abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr> (63–72<abbr title="inches">in</abbr>).
It is a social species, 
forming groups called <strong> prides </strong>. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together,
preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and <em> keystone predator</em>, although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur, and have been known to hunt 
humans, although the species typically does not. </p>

<p> Typically, the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas, but is absent in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted it adapts 
to being active at night and at twilight. In the Pleistocene, the lion ranged throughout Eurasia, Africa and North America, but today it has been reduced to 
fragmented populations in Sub-Saharan Africa and one critically endangered population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the
<strong> IUCN</strong> Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43<abbr title="percent">%</abbr> since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside 
designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.</p>

<p>One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, 
and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition 
in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of lions were prominent in the Upper Paleolithic period; carvings and 
paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves in France have been dated to 17,000 years ago, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval culture
that coincided with the lion's former and current ranges. </p>

<h2 style="font-family:forte;">Etymology</h2
<p>The word 'lion' is derived from Latin: leo and Ancient Greek:<i> (leon)</i>. The word lavi  may also be related.The generic name Panthera
is traceable to the classical Latin word <i> panthera</i> and the ancient Greek word <i> panther</i>.Panthera is phonetically similar to the Sanskrit word 
<i>pând-ara</i> meaning pale yellow, whitish, white.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:forte;">Taxonomy</h2>

<p> <i>Felis leo</i> was the scientific name used by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, who described the lion in his work Systema Naturae. The genus name Panthera was coined by
German naturalist Lorenz Oken in 1816. Between the mid-18th and mid-20th centuries, 26 lion specimens were described and proposed as subspecies, of which 11
were recognised as valid in 2005.They were distinguished on the basis of appearance, size and colour of mane. Because these characteristics show much variation 
between individuals, most of these forms were probably not true subspecies, especially because they were often based upon museum material with "striking, but abnormal" morphological characteristics.</p>


<h2 style="font-family:forte;">Skeleton</h2>
<p>The lion is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears. Its fur varies in colour from light buff to silvery grey, 
yellowish red and dark brown. The colours of the underparts are generally lighter. A new-born lion has dark spots, which fade as the cub reaches adulthood, although 
faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts. The lion is the only member of the cat family that displays obvious sexual dimorphism. Males have 
broader heads and a prominent mane that grows downwards and backwards covering most of the head, neck, shoulders, and chest. The mane is typically brownish and tinged 
with yellow, rust and black hairs.

<p> The tail of all lions ends in a dark, hairy tuft that in some lions conceals an approximately 5 <abbr title="milimeters">mm</abbr> (0.20 <abbr title="inches">in</abbr>)long, hard "spine" or "spur" that is formed from the 
final, fused sections of tail bone. The functions of the spur are unknown. The tuft is absent at birth and develops at around 1/2 months of age. It is readily 
identifiable by the age of seven months.</p>

<p> Of the living felid species, the lion is rivaled only by the tiger in length, weight and height at the shoulder. Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, 
although the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened, and has a slightly shorter postorbital region and broader nasal openings than those of the tiger.
Due to the amount of skull variation in the two species, usually only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species.

<p>The size and weight of adult lions varies across global range and habitats. Accounts of a few individuals that were larger than average exist from Africa and India.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:forte;">Behaviour and ecology</h2>

<p> Lions spend much of their time resting; they are inactive for about 20 hours per day.Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks 
after dusk with a period of socialising, grooming and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity continue until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. 
They spend an average of two hours a day walking and 50 minutes eating.</p>
